# Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a company's customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment to maximize the value of each customer to the business. In this project we will be using K-Means clustering method of unsupervised learning to visualize the gender and age distributions to analyse their annual incomes and spending scores using Python.
